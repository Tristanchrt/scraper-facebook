# **Extract Facebook**

This microservice is one of the data extraction methods used in the Profil'Hunt project. It uses **Selenium** to perform graphical interactions with the site and wait for the time needed to collect information with **BeautifulSoup4**.

## **Installation and using the application**

Create the network docker:
```
docker network create ph-test
```

## **Configuration**

The microservice requires some configuration before it can be run. This includes things like database connection details, API keys, and other settings. These configuration settings can be stored in a **.env** file. Let's add our informations to perform a search:

```bash
nano .env > ACCOUNT_USERNAME=<your_linkedin_account_login>
nano .env > ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=<your_linkedin_account_password>
```

Make sure to update the settings before starting the microservice.

## **How to use**

To start FaceBook's extraction microservice, run:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up extract-facebook
```

**Note**: The first time you run this command, it may be not work because the Selenium remote session has not been finished its initialization. Don't panic and run again `docker-compose up extract-facebook`.

Now, open a web browser and go to : `localhost:4444`

You will be able to see yours Selenium remote sessions, and the first one should be the our Facebook's extraction. (The password to access to the session is `secret`)

- topic name: Name of the current topic.

    - Example: `['tristan', 'chretien', 'lyon']`

### **Output (dev)**
